   cd your-project-name
   ```

## Adding New Components

2. Write your component using TypeScript and React.
3. Import and use your component in `App.tsx` or other components.

## Styling with Tailwind CSS

This project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. You can add classes directly to your JSX elements:

```jsx
<div className="bg-blue-500 text-white p-4 rounded-lg">
  Hello, Tailwind!
</div>
```

## Building for Production

To create a production build, run:

```
npm run build
```

This will generate a `dist` folder with your compiled assets, ready for deployment.
